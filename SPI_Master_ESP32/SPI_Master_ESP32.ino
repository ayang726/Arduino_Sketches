/* The ESP32 has four SPi buses, however as of right now only two of
 * them are available to use, HSPI and VSPI. Simply using the SPI API 
 * as illustrated in Arduino examples will use VSPI, leaving HSPI unused.
 * 
 * However if we simply intialise two instance of the SPI class for both
 * of these buses both can be used. However when just using these the Arduino
 * way only will actually be outputting at a time.
 * 
 * Logic analyser capture is in the same folder as this example as
